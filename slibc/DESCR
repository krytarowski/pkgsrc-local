This library provides an implementation of the bounds-checking C functions
(as specified in Annex K of the current C standard, a.k.a. C11) for use with
the GNU C library.

These functions lower the risk of introducing security vulnerabilities such as
buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities into your code by providing
clear and easy-to-use interfaces. For each C function a secure alternate
function ending in a "_s" postfix is provided (e.g., strcpy_s). Use of these
functions is recommended by security experts and secure coding standards (CERT
Secure Coding Standard C).

This library consists of
    -) a thread-safe implementation of all functions specified in the ISO
       Standard (except widechar functions)
    -) API documentation for all functions
    -) test cases for all functions
    -) overloaded C++ template functions for easier use when compiling with g++
