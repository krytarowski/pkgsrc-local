tcplay is a free (BSD-licensed), pretty much fully featured (including multiple
keyfiles, cipher cascades, etc) and stable TrueCrypt implementation.

This implementation supports mapping (opening) both system and normal TrueCrypt
volumes, as well as opening hidden volumes and opening an outer volume while
protecting a hidden volume. There is also support to create volumes, including
hidden volumes, etc. Since version 1.1, there is also support for restoring
from the backup header (if present), change passphrase, keyfile and PBKDF2 PRF
function.

Since tcplay uses dm-crypt (or dm_target_crypt on DragonFly) it makes full use
of any available hardware encryption/decryption support once the volume has
been mapped.

It is based solely on the documentation available on the TrueCrypt website,
many hours of trial and error and the output of the Linux' TrueCrypt client. As
it turns out, most technical documents on TrueCrypt contain mistakes, hence the
trial and error approach.
