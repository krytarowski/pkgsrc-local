ChakraCore is the core part of Chakra, the high-performance JavaScript engine
that powers Microsoft Edge and Windows applications written in HTML/CSS/JS.
ChakraCore supports Just-in-time (JIT) compilation of JavaScript for
x86/x64/ARM, garbage collection, and a wide range of the latest JavaScript
features. ChakraCore also supports the JavaScript Runtime (JSRT) APIs, which
allows you to easily embed ChakraCore in your applications.
