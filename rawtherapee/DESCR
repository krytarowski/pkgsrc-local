RawTherapee is a libre software designed for developing raw files from a broad
range of digital cameras, as well as HDR DNG files and non-raw image formats
(JPEG, TIFF and PNG). The target audience ranges from enthusiast newcomers who
wish to broaden their understanding of how digital imaging works to
semi-professional photographers. Knowledge in color science is not compulsory,
but it is recommended that you are eager to learn and ready to read our
documentation (RawPedia) as well as look up basic concepts which lie outside
the scope of RawPedia, such as color balance, elsewhere.

Of course, professionals may use RawTherapee too while enjoying complete
freedom, but will probably lack some peripheral features such as Digital Asset
Management, printing, uploading, etc. RawTherapee is not aimed at being an
inclusive all-in-one program, and the open-source community is sufficiently
developed by now to offer all those peripheral features in other specialized
software.
