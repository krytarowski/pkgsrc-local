GemRB (Game Engine Made with preRendered Background) is a "port"
(actually a new implementation) of the original Infinity Engine (the one
of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, ...) to
Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows with some enhancements. Would you like to
create a game like Baldur's Gate?

It means that you either need some of the original game's data
somewhere on your harddisk, or you can try to use the data from the
Dragonlance Total Conversion projet.
