PinkTrace is a lightweight C99 library that eases the writing of tracing
applications. It consists of the following parts:

 - Wrappers around different ptrace() requests.
 - An API for decoding arguments (strings, socket addresses, ...)
 - An experimental API for encoding arguments.
 - An initial implementation of a callback-driven higher-level library called
   pinktrace-easy.
